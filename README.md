A fun project: Do a web based coffee pot content monitoring by measure its weight by an raspberry and a HX711

This is just the ready-to-go-all-in-once installation script, whichs turn a virgin raspian image into a HX711 powered scale to measure the weight of a coffee pot to provide the status and its changes through a web interface to browser clients running on the coffee consumers desktops.

So each consumer can decide without leaving the desk if it's worth to go for another coffee or if its better to wait until somebody else has brew some new one first ;-)
